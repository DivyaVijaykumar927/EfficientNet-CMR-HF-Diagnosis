EfficientNet-CMR-HF-Diagnosis
An Intelligent Ensemble EfficientNet Prediction System for Cardiac MRI-Based Heart Failure Severity Diagnosis
Overview
This project focuses on diagnosing heart failure severity using an ensemble of EfficientNet models (B0â€“B7) trained on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The system leverages multiple EfficientNet variants optimized with Adam, SGD, and RMSprop to enhance predictive accuracy.

Key Features
âœ” Uses EfficientNet models (B0â€“B7) for feature extraction from CMR images.
âœ” Evaluates model performance with Adam, SGD, and RMSprop optimizers.
âœ” Selects the best-performing models based on sensitivity and specificity.
âœ” Combines predictions using a weighted ensemble method.
âœ” Achieves a testing accuracy of 0.95 with significant improvements in class-wise sensitivity.
